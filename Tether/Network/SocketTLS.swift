//  Shared helpers for the SecureTransport-over-BSD-socket stack used by both the
//  packet connection and payload transfers.
//
//  KDE Connect upgrades an already-open TCP stream to TLS after a plaintext
//  identity line, which Network.framework cannot express, so the raw socket and
//  SecureTransport stay. What these helpers change is how we wait: instead of
//  sleeping in a loop and hoping the socket is ready, we block in poll() until
//  the kernel says it is, bounded by an explicit deadline.
